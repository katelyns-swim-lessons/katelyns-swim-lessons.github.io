        <h2>What do you recommend in terms of floating/swimming devices?</h2>
        <p>Puddle jumpers are okay to use until your child takes lessons. After your child takes
            lessons I recommend a speedo swim vest. This will allow your child to use big arms and practice their skills, while also being in a floating device. 
            I recommend families to 
            have their child practice their swimming before they can "earn" their vest. This helps 
            kids to remember what they have learned and progress even further. Please do not 
            bring a floating device to swim lessons

            <h2>Can we bring food?</h2>
            <p>There is no food allowed in the pool area. Due to allergies of family members and 
            students, I have a strict no food policy in the pool and on the deck. Water is allowed</p>
            <h2>Can I bring siblings?</h2>
            <p>Yes, you may bring siblings. Remember, you are entering someone else's yard and
             property so please be respectful. I suggest that you bring something quiet to entertain 
             your children such as electronics or a coloring book while your children sit next to you on the pool deck</p>
            <h2>What happens if it rains?</h2>
            <p>I teach in the rain, if it is thundering or lightning, lessons will be cancelled. I will do my 
            best to reschedule lessons. If possible, group lessons will be rescheduled for Thursday 
            and private lessons will be made up throughtout the week. I will post to Facebook
             and call each family if class is cancelled.</p>
            <h2>What happens if I have to cancel, will I get my money back?</h2>
            <p>If you have to cancel for group lessons before they start you will not get your $10 
            deposit back. If you cancel in the middle of the week you will not be refunded. Any missed sessions will be rescheduled if possible.
