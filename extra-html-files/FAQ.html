        <H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
          <h2>What type of payment do you accept?</h2>
          <p>I only accept cash and checks.</p>

          <h2>What do I do after I fill out the application?</h2>
<p>After the application closes, I will call you.  Once your child is signed up for a time slot you will receive an email with the waiver and liability form, your child’s weeks and time slot, my mailing address, and your total.  You will have until April 1 to print the waiver and liability form and mail that to me with cash or a check for $20 per child/per week. </p>

          <h2>What should I do with my child who is not old enough to take lessons?</h2>
<p>Feel free to reach out if you are unsure about if your child is old enough for lessons. If your child is not ready for lessons there are many things you can practice with them.  First, you can practice taking breaths.  Asking the child to take a big breath and hold it is a big thing that the students learn in the first week of lessons.  You can also practice blowing bubbles, kicking their feet, using big arms, singing songs and playing in the water to help them be comfortable.</p>  

          <h2>What do you need for lessons?</h2>
<p>Your child will need a swimsuit and towel.  Please do not bring goggles for your child unless needed for medical reasons.</p>

          <h2>Should I (the parent) have a swimsuit on?</h2><P>
          No.  Parents do not get in the water with their children.</P>

          <H2>Am I allowed to watch my child?  Or should I leave?</H2>
  <p>You are your child’s biggest cheerleader.  I encourage all caregivers to watch their children!  It is important to tell the child how brave they are and take many pictures and videos.  If your child is crying I may ask you to step out of the child’s sight.  Please do not leave the property.</p>

          <h2>What do you recommend in terms of floating/swimming devices?</h2><p>
Puddle jumpers are okay to use until your child takes lessons.  After your child takes lessons I recommend a <a href="\index.html"> Speedo swim vest</a>.  This will allow your child to use big arms and practice their skills, while also being in a floating device.  I recommend that a child must practice swimming before they can “earn” their vest.  This helps kids to remember what they have learned and progress even further.  Please do not bring a floating device to swim lessons.</p>

          <h2>Can we bring food?</h2>
          <p>
There is no food allowed in the pool area.  Due to allergies of family members and students, I have a strict no-food policy in the pool and on the deck.  Water is allowed.</p>

          <h2>Can I bring siblings?</h2>
 <p> Yes.  You may bring siblings.  Remember, you are entering someone else’s yard and property so please be respectful.  I suggest that you bring something quiet to entertain your children such as electronics or a coloring book while your children sit next to you on the pool deck.</p>

          <h2>What happens if it rains?</h2>
    <p>I teach in the rain.  If it is thundering or lightning, lessons will be canceled.  All lessons will be rescheduled for Thursday.  I will post to Facebook and call each family if their class is canceled.</P>

<h2> What happens if I have to cancel?  Will I get my money back?</h2>
<p>  If you have to cancel, you will not get your $20 deposit back. I am open to rescheduling if sickness comes up and if my schedule allows it.  If you cancel in the middle of the week you will not be refunded.  Any missed sessions will be rescheduled if possible.</P>

          <h2>Illnesses: </h2>
<P>If your child is feeling ill, please stay home and let me know.  I will try to reschedule your lessons but can not guarantee a make-up class.  </P>

          <h2>Do you have options for working parents?</h2>
<p>Yes!!  Please refer to my schedule for my hours for each summer.  I make sure to offer evening classes to accommodate working parents.  I am also comfortable if another trusted adult brings your child to swim lessons as many parents work in the summer. </p>

<h2>When is a child considered “graduated”?  Where should I go to find further swimming experience or practice?</h2>
<p>This is a complicated question.  I suggest having a conversation with me personally about your child, but here are some general guidelines.  What do you want your child to get out of swim lessons?  My biggest goal is their safety.  If your child knows how to swim and how to save themselves, they no longer NEED lessons.  If you would like your child to develop more advanced skills such as strokes, side breaths, and diving, they can continue to take lessons.  It depends on how far you want your child to progress and how much money you are willing to spend.  I was not on the swim team, nor am I a professional swimmer.  I specialize in survival skills.  If I believe that I no longer have the skills to teach your child I will let you know.  To further your child’s experience, I recommend joining a swim team.  In terms of where to go for more swimming, many local schools have open swim nights or a membership at the YMCA can be beneficial.  Once a child learns the skills they need, the most important thing is practice.  I highly encourage you to be in the water with your children and encourage them to practice the skills they have learned.</p>

<h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of group lessons, semi-private lessons, and private lessons?</h2>
<p>Group Lessons:  The advantage of group lessons would be the involvement of peers.  When a child sees other children their age being brave and trying new things, they are more likely to try these things.  I also find that students learn best from modeling.  It can be tricky for my helpers and me to properly model to the students what we expect, but they learn well from watching their peers.  By the same token, if your child is nervous about lessons and there are already other children in their class that are crying or nervous, this peer relation could trigger your child and cause their nerves and tears to increase.  If you have taken lessons from me before, I am very strategic in placing students with each other.  If I know your child is on the nervous side, I will place them in a group of students who are bold and outgoing to encourage them.  This does become more difficult if I do not know your child yet.
Semi-private lessons:  This is my first year officially offering this and I am so excited!  This is great for families with multiple kids, or if you want your child in a class with a friend.  There will be 2 students in a class and 1-2 teachers.  This gives your child more one-on-one time and instruction from me and my helper.  Having one-on-one time with each of us, allows the child to learn new things due to our different personalities.  In addition to this, your child receives peer support.  With two kids in the pool at a time, it allows the students to compete, race, and cheer each other on, even if they are not at the same level.  
Private lessons: Private lessons are also a great option.  These lessons are only 20 minutes because the child is working the whole time, instead of taking turns with other students.  By having one-on-one lessons, the student receives more instructional time and forms a deeper bond with me.  This is best for students who are extremely scared or who might need extra attention for other reasons.</p>

          <h2>Where are you located?</h2>
          <p>This year I have host pools in Byron Center, Zeeland, and Hudsonville!</p>

          <h2>Do you provide a discount for multiple students in one family?</h2>
<p>No.  Unfortunately, I do not provide a discount for families with more than one student in swim lessons.</p>

          <h2>What happens if I miss the application?</h2>
<p>You are welcome to text or email me, but if you do not apply between February 17 and 20, you will be put at the end of the waiting list, with no acceptions.  Last year I did not have spots for everyone who applied in the original application.</p>

          <h2>Did you say something about a water safety guide?</h2>
<p>Yes!  I am still figuring this out.  As of right now, the safety guide will be sold separately.  This is not available yet and may change.  Stay tuned for more information coming in the Spring! </p>
