        <H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
        <h2>What type of payment do you accept</h2>
            <p>I am only accepting cash and checks. I am NOT using Venmo this year because of the additional fees.</p>
        <h2>What do I do after I fill out the registration?</h2>
            <p>After Registration closes, I will call you. For group lessons, once your student is signed
            up for a time slot you have until April 1 to print the waiver and liability form and to
            mail that to me with a check for $10 per child/per week. You will recieve an email with the details that we decided for
            your child and the waiver and liability form.</p>
        <h2>What should I do with my child who is not old enough to take lessons</h2>
            <p>Feel free to reach out if you are unsure about if your child is old enough for lessons. 
            If your child is not ready for lessons there are many things you can practice with them.
            First, you can practice taking breaths. Asking the child to take a big breath and hold it is
            a big thing that the students learn in the first week of lessons. You can also practice 
            blowing bubbles, kicking their feet, using big arms, singing songs, and playing in the
            water to help them be comfortable.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you need for lessons?</h2>
            <p>Your child will need a swimsuit and towel. Please DO NOT bring goggles for your child
            unless needed for medical reasons. I teach the kids how to swim with their eyes open. 
            The pool is a salt water pool which will not hurt the child's eyes.</p>
        <h2>Should I, the parent, have a swim suit on?</h2>
            <p>No, Parents do not get in the water with their child.</p>
        <h2>Am I allowed to watch my child, or Should I leave?</h2>
            <p>You are your child's biggest cheerleader. I encourage all caregivers to watch their child! 
            It is important to tell the child how brave they are and take many pictures and videos. If 
            your child is crying I may ask you to step out of the child's sight.</p>
