        <h2>What type of payment do you accept</h2>
            <p>I am only accepting cash and checks. I am NOT using Venmo this year because of the additional fees.</p>
        <h2>What do I do after I fill out the registration?</h2>
            <p>After Registration closes, I will call you. For group lessons, once your student is signed
            up for a time slot you have until April 1 to print the waiver and liability form and to
            mail that to me with a check for $10 per child/per week. You will recieve an email with the details that we decided for
            your child and the waiver and liability form.</p>
        <h2>What should I do with my child who is not old enough to take lessons</h2>
            <p>Feel free to reach out if you are unsure about if your child is old enough for lessons. 
            If your child is not ready for lessons there are many things you can practice with them.
            First, you can practice taking breaths. Asking the child to take a big breath and hold it is
            a big thing that the students learn in the first week of lessons. You can also practice 
            blowing bubbles, kicking their feet, using big arms, singing songs, and playing in the
            water to help them be comfortable.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you need for lessons?</h2>
            <p>Your child will need a swimsuit and towel. Please DO NOT bring goggles for your child
            unless needed for medical reasons. I teach the kids how to swim with their eyes open. 
            The pool is a salt water pool which will not hurt the child's eyes.</p>
        <h2>Should I, the parent, have a swim suit on?</h2>
            <p>No, Parents do not get in the water with their child.</p>
        <h2>Am I allowed to watch my child, or Should I leave?</h2>
            <p>You are your child's biggest cheerleader. I encourage all caregivers to watch their child! 
            It is important to tell the child how brave they are and take many pictures and videos. If 
            your child is crying I may ask you to step out of the child's sight.</p>
                  <h2>What do you recommend in terms of floating/swimming devices?</h2>
        <p>Puddle jumpers are okay to use until your child takes lessons. After your child takes
            lessons I recommend a speedo swim vest. This will allow your child to use big arms and practice their skills, while also being in a floating device. 
            I recommend families to 
            have their child practice their swimming before they can "earn" their vest. This helps 
            kids to remember what they have learned and progress even further. Please do not 
            bring a floating device to swim lessons

            <h2>Can we bring food?</h2>
            <p>There is no food allowed in the pool area. Due to allergies of family members and 
            students, I have a strict no food policy in the pool and on the deck. Water is allowed</p>
            <h2>Can I bring siblings?</h2>
            <p>Yes, you may bring siblings. Remember, you are entering someone else's yard and
             property so please be respectful. I suggest that you bring something quiet to entertain 
             your children such as electronics or a coloring book while your children sit next to you on the pool deck</p>
            <h2>What happens if it rains?</h2>
            <p>I teach in the rain, if it is thundering or lightning, lessons will be cancelled. I will do my 
            best to reschedule lessons. If possible, group lessons will be rescheduled for Thursday 
            and private lessons will be made up throughtout the week. I will post to Facebook
             and call each family if class is cancelled.</p>
            <h2>What happens if I have to cancel, will I get my money back?</h2>
            <p>If you have to cancel for group lessons before they start you will not get your $10 
            deposit back. If you cancel in the middle of the week you will not be refunded. Any missed sessions will be rescheduled if possible.
