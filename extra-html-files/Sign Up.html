Application instructions:
When you open the application you will first have to fill out personal information.  There is an option to skip this if you have taken lessons from me before.  Hopefully, this makes application easier for those who are returning!
You will then be asked to pick what kind of lessons you want.  This year I am offering 3 types of lessons: group, semi-private and private.  All lessons are for 3 days: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Please reserve Thursday in case of thunderstorms.
GROUP lessons are $50 total, 30 minutes long, and have 3-6 students and 1-3 instructors in the pool at a time.  
SEMI-PRIVATE lessons are $55 total, 25 minutes long, and have 2-3 students and 1-2 instructors in the pool at a time.  This is great for siblings or friends.  
PRIVATE lessons are $65 total, 20 minutes long, and will have 1 student and 1 instructor (Miss Katelyn) in the pool at a time.
You will then be asked to fill out what weeks you are available.  This is a preview of my 2023 schedule:

Finally, you will be asked to insert your child’s name, age, and level.  Students must be 3.  If your child is 2, you may apply and when I call to register your family, we can talk about the best time for swimming lessons for your child.  If you are unsure of your child’s level, we can discuss that during registration as well.
Levels:
0: Students have no experience in swimming lessons and little to no experience in the water.
0+: Students have some experience in swimming lessons but are not swimming on their own.  OR Students have no experience in swimming lessons but are extremely comfortable in the water.
1: Students can swim with their faces in the water on their own, but not confidently and not long distances.
1+: Students are more comfortable and confident in the water.  Students will learn how to jump off the diving board and swim to the ladder.
2: Students can swim across the width of the pool.  The students are starting to show interest in taking breaths on their own.
3: Students can take breaths on their own.  During this level, students will become comfortable floating on their backs.  
3+: Students are starting to swim the length of the pool but might get tired and need some assistance.
4: Students can comfortably swim the length of the pool and are starting to learn new strokes and dives.
Finally, there is a place for you to leave any additional comments or questions.  

After the application closes, I will put all of the applications in a bowl and hold a raffle drawing until all of the spots are full.  This will take several days and I will continue posting updates on my Facebook page.  Once all spots are full, I will email everyone who did not get a spot.  If any spots open up throughout the spring and summer those who applied, but did not get in, will be contacted first.
