        <h1>Hi! My name is Katelyn Benes and I teach swim lesons to students of all ages and abilities.</h1>
        <p>
        I follow an advanced swin lesson program.
        This means that if your child does not know how to swin coming into lessons, I hope to have them swimming within 3-6 days. I startlessons at 3 years old and have taught children as old as 18.
        My goal for all ages is safety. Once your beginner learns how to swim, they will then learn to swim to the wall and what to do if they fall into the water.
        I focus on safety with my older kids too. I will teach the older kids strokes and dives that can be used for fun recreationally or on a swim team! Along with that I focus on safety and ask the kids questions about what they would do if they fell off a boat. if it's okay to run around a pool, etc.
        I would love to teach your child how to swim and how to safely have fun iin the water! For beginners I recommend 2 weeks of lessons. For older children I recommend 1 week.
        Please reach out if you have any questions!

            I am attending Taylor University in Indiana. I am studying Elementary Education with a minor in Bible. I love swimming, hanging out with my friends, and eating ice cream!
            On any given summer day you can find me teaching swim lessons, biking, or reading a book by the pool. On any given winter day you can find me doing homework, hanging out with friends, or watching a movie.
