            Miss. Katelyn's Swim lessons provides survival swim lessons for ages 3-18 I'm here to help you and your children
     learn how to swim, improve their abilities, brush up on swimming skills, and commit to memory some very important water safety tips. </h2>
        
        <p>
        I follow an advanced swin lesson program.
        This means that if your child does not know how to swin coming into lessons, I hope to have them swimming within 3-6 days. I startlessons at 3 years old and have taught children as old as 18.
        My goal for all ages is safety. Once your beginner learns how to swim, they will then learn to swim to the wall and what to do if they fall into the water.
        I focus on safety with my older kids too. I will teach the older kids strokes and dives that can be used for fun recreationally or on a swim team! Along with that I focus on safety and ask the kids questions about what they would do if they fell off a boat. if it's okay to run around a pool, etc.
        I would love to teach your child how to swim and how to safely have fun iin the water! For beginners I recommend 2 weeks of lessons. For older children I recommend 1 week.
        Please reach out if you have any questions!
